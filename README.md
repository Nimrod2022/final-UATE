### Project description

* The UATE project aimed to develop a spatial data infrastructure (SDI) to track and analyze Ukrainian asylum seekers and refugee migration to Europe over the past decade. 
* The project was built on Python Django framework. It integrated geospatial data processing and visualization techniques to offer insights into migration patterns. 
Project data was sourced from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and enriched with location information using Googleâ€™s Geocoding API.
* The SDI used Python for backend development, JavaScript and Tailwind CSS for frontend , leveraging Chart.js library for data visualization and Google Maps JavaScript API as the mapping library. 
* The project data was stored and managed in a PostgreSQL/PostGIS database. GeoServer was used to facilitate publishing of geospatial data as Web Feature Services (WFS) and Web Map Services (WMS), allowing for dynamic data retrieval and mapping from the Django framework. 
* Results from the project demonstrated the power of integrating various open-source and low-cost technologies to create a comprehensive tool for an SDI. 
The dashboard provides a valuable resource for students, researchers, and policymakers, offering detailed visualizations of migration trends and the ability to drill down into specific data points.
